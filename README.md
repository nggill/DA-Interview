This repository is my submission for a Data Analyst position at my current company, Fetch. There are four steps to the coding challenge given to assess skill and problem solving abilities. These four steps include structural data relational modeling, building queries, digging deeper into data, and communicating effectively. I hope this public repository provides insights and teachable, learning moments to both you and myself as I go through this process.
